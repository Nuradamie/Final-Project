    <td>During my kindergarten life my mother is the first person that found my talent in singing,
        storytelling and also every single thing activity that related to talking and I am extrovert 
        students thats time. My teacher teacher Norizan is the person that always keep teachimg me the
        best way
        to be a great person in every competition. Eventhought im not really good in sport i found that i have talent in
        be a good speaker or mc of event. The best memory is when i get the first prize in the story telling competition
        my mother is so supportive where she spend her time to sew my costume that time. I really love the costume and 
        everyone is shock with my appearance int that competition. The memory when i start to have passion in this
        Experience
        it really can be forget. My parents is my big support that always believe that I am able to do what I am passion and i 
        really love the support from my family so munch. From what I know and I learn every person in  this always have their parents 
        as a big supporters in their life. Without our parents we will develope the spirit and treasure in order to sucess in life.

    <td>This is some of medal and awards that i gain during my experience in winning every competition. Every time
        i get the medal I am very proud to show its to my mother. I believe that every sucess that i gain is from 
        my responsibilities in always practices untill it be perfect. I never stop my passion even when I enter the
        universities life I stil love to enter every competition like this. i found that its really enjoyable when
        you get to work it something that you love. In universiteies I always enter the news reading competition,
        singing competition and also when there is an event I always to welcome my self to join the event and at 
        the same time i will see the MC reading their prompter. And from that I start to volunteer my self when 
        an event need an MC and also a moderator for the event or occasion and celebration.
